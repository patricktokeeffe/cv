  Abstract                 = {Local meteorology, crop management practices and site characteristics have important impacts on carbon and water cycling in agricultural ecosystems. This study focuses on carbon and water fluxes measured using eddy covariance (EC) methods and crop simulation models in the Inland Pacific Northwest (IPNW), in association with the Regional Approaches to Climate Change (REACCH) program. The agricultural ecosystem is currently challenged by higher pressure on water resources as a consequence of population growth and increasing exposure to impacts associated with different types of crop managements. In addition, future climate projections for this region show a likely increase in temperature and significant reductions in precipitation that will affect carbon and water dynamics. This new scenario requires an understanding of crop management by assessing efficient ways to face the impacts of climate change at the micrometeorological level, especially in regards to carbon and water flow. We focus on three different crop management sites. One site (LIND) under crop-fallow is situated in a low-rainfall area. The other two sites, one no-till site (CAF-NT) and one conventional tillage site (CAF-CT), are located in an area of high-rainfall with continuous cropping. In this study, we used CropSyst micro-basin model to simulate the responses in carbon and water budgets at each site. Based on the EC processed results for net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2, the CAF-NT site was a carbon sink during 2013 when spring garbanzo was planted; while the paired CAF-CT site, under similar crop rotation and meteorological conditions, was a carbon source during the same period. The LIND site was also a carbon sink where winter wheat was growing during 2013. Model results for CAF-NT showed good agreement with the EC carbon and water flux measurements during 2013. Through comparisons between measurements and modeling results, both short and long term processes that influence carbon and water cycling in the agricultural ecosystems are better understood.},

  Abstract                 = {Accurate carbon and water flux simulations for croplands are greatly dependent on high quality representation of management practices and meteorological conditions, which are key drivers of the surface-atmosphere exchange processes. Fourteen site-years of carbon and water fluxes were simulated using the CropSyst model over four agricultural sites in the inland Pacific Northwest (iPNW) US from October 1, 2011 to September 30, 2015. Model performance for field-scale net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) and evapotranspiration (ET) was evaluated by comparing simulations with long-term eddy covariance measurements. The model captured the temporal variations of NEE and ET reasonably well with an overall r of 0.78 and 0.80, and a low RMSE of 1.82 g C m−2 d−1 and 0.84 mm d−1 for NEE and ET, respectively. The model slightly underestimated NEE and ET by 0.51 g C m−2 d−1 and 0.09 mm d−1, respectively. ET simulations showed better agreement with eddy covariance measurements than NEE. The model performed much better for the sites with detailed initial conditions (e.g., SOC content) and management practice information (e.g., tillage type). The CropSyst results showed that the winter wheat fields could be annual net carbon sinks or close to neutral with the net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) ranging from 92 to −17 g C m−2, while the spring crop fields were net carbon sources or neutral with an annual NECB of −327 to −3 g C m−2. Simulations for the paired tillage sites showed that the no-till site resulted in lower CO2 emissions for the crop rotations of winter wheat-spring garbanzo, but had higher carbon loss into the atmosphere for spring canola compared to the conventional tillage site. Water budgets did not differ significantly between the two tillage systems. Winter wheat in the high-rainfall area had higher crop yields and water use efficiency but emitted larger amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere than in the low-rainfall area. Based on model evaluations in this study, CropSyst appears promising as a tool to simulate field-scale carbon and water budgets and assess the effects of different management practices and local meteorological conditions for the wheat-based cropping systems in this region.},

  Abstract                 = {Analysis of carbon and water budgets in cropping systems is important for understanding the impacts of different management practices and meteorological conditions, in the context of climate change, on agriculture. We have established a pair of long-term eddy covariance flux towers at the R. J. Cook Agronomy Farm (CAF) near Pullman, Washington, US. The tower sites have similar crop rotation, weather conditions, and management practices except tillage. One site has been under no-till management (CAF-NT) since 1998, while the other site has used conventional tillage practice (CAF-CT) over the same time period. Measurements conducted above a garbanzo bean crop (Cicer arietinum) between October 2012 and September 2013 showed the CAF-NT site was close to CO2 neutral with an annual cumulative net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) of −20 ± 38 g C m−2. By contrast, the CAF-CT site was a CO2 source with an annual NEE of 117 ± 39 g C m−2 during the same time period. The annual NEE values at each site were significantly different (p < 0.05). When carbon losses via harvest export were taken into account, the net rates of carbon loss from each ecosystem to the atmosphere were 32 ± 50 and 178 ± 48 g C m−2 for CAF-NT and CAF-CT, respectively, indicating CAF-NT was close to carbon neutral and CAF-CT was a net carbon source during the measurement period. Partitioning of NEE into gross primary productivity (GPP) and total ecosystem respiration (Reco) shows that the annual cumulative GPP of each site did not differ much, but CAF-NT had lower annual cumulative Reco compared to CAF-CT during the period of October 2012–September 2013. Water budget analyses presented similar magnitudes of annual sums of evapotranspiration (ET), 425 and 416 mm for CAF-NT and CAF-CT, respectively. ET was partitioned into evaporation (E) and transpiration (T) for both sites, and CAF-CT had a larger fraction of annual E compared to CAF-NT during the measurement period. Relationships between carbon and water fluxes were investigated, and for the period of October 2012–September 2013, high correlations were found in GPP vs. T and NEE vs. ET at both sites. In summary, the site deploying no-till practices had lower total ecosystem respiration and evaporation throughout the measurement period, more net carbon uptake and a greater ratio of transpiration over evapotranspiration (T/ET) during the growing season.},

  Abstract                 = {Cropland is an important land cover influencing global carbon and water cycles. Variability of agricultural carbon and water fluxes depends on crop species, management practices, soil characteristics, and climatic conditions. In the context of climate change, it is critical to quantify the long-term effects of these environmental drivers and farming activities on carbon and water dynamics. Twenty site-years of carbon and water fluxes covering a large precipitation gradient and a variety of crop species and management practices were measured in the inland Pacific Northwest using the eddy covariance method. The rain-fed fields were net carbon sinks, while the irrigated site was close to carbon neutral during the winter wheat crop years. Sites growing spring crops were either carbon sinks, sources, or neutral, varying with crops, rainfall zones, and tillage practices. Fluxes were more sensitive to variability in precipitation than temperature: annual carbon and water fluxes increased with the increasing precipitation while only respiration increased with temperature in the high-rainfall area. Compared to a nearby rain-fed site, irrigation improved winter wheat production but resulted in large losses of carbon and water to the atmosphere. Compared to conventional tillage, no-till had significantly lower respiration but resulted in slightly lower yields and water use efficiency over 4 years. Under future climate change, it is expected that more carbon fixation by crops and evapotranspiration would occur in a warmer and wetter environment.},

  Abstract                 = {Infiltration rates, or the rate of air exchange, of houses are important to understand because ventilation can be a dominate factor in determining indoor air quality. There are chemicals that are emitted from surfaces or point sources inside the home which are harmful to humans; these chemicals come from various objects including furniture, cleaning supplies, building materials, gas stoves, and the surrounding environment. The use of proper ventilation to cycle cleaner outdoor air into the house can be crucial for maintaining healthy living conditions in the home. At the same time, there can also be outdoor pollutants which infiltrate the house and contribute to poor indoor air quality. In either case, it is important to determine infiltration rates as a function of outdoor weather conditions, the house structure properties and indoor heating and cooling systems. In this work, the objective is to measure ventilation rates using periodic releases of a tracer gas and measuring how quickly the tracer concentration decays. CO2 will be used as the tracer gas because it is inert and harmless at low levels. An Arduino timer is connected to a release valve which controls the release of 9.00 SLPM of CO2 into the uptake vent within the test home. CO2 will be released until there is at least a 200 to 300 ppm increase above ambient indoor levels. Computers with CO2 sensors and temperature/pressure sensors attached will be used to record data from different locations within the home which will continuously record data up to a week. The results from these periodic ventilation measurements will be analyzed with respect to outdoor wind and temperature conditions and house structure properties. The data will be used to evaluate an established indoor air quality model.},

  Abstract                 = {As the world's urban population continues to grow, the environmental problems associated with large population centers continue to be exacerbated. Because of this, understanding the environmental impacts of the world's large urban areas is becoming more and more important, especially in areas of the world for which limited data exists. In this study, measurements of a suite of air pollutants were made in Xi'an, China in August of 2011, to assess the concentrations and emission trends of air pollutants in an emerging Chinese megacity. The study site was located on the campus of Jaiotong University, with the sampling inlet positioned at the top of a 23 meter scaffold tower which was on top of a 100 meter tall building. In this study, measurements of nitrogen oxides (NOx) were made by chemiluminescence, measurements of carbon monoxide (CO) and ozone (O3) were made by absorption spectroscopy, and measurements of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were made by proton transfer reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS). CO, O3, and VOC data were taken for approximately three weeks, while NOx data were taken for ten days at the end of the campaign. VOC data was in the form of low frequency mass scans for the first half of the campaign and of high frequency measurements of acetaldehyde, benzene, and toluene for the second half. The diel trends in the mixing ratios of CO, NOx, acetaldehyde, benzene, and toluene displayed an increase at sunrise associated with morning vehicle traffic, a maximum in the mid morning and a minimum in the late afternoon. Ozone mixing ratios displayed the trend typical to urban areas, increasing after sunrise to a maximum in the late afternoon and decreasing to a minimum in the early morning. CO-to-NOx molar ratios were calculated by plotting CO against NOx and creating a linear fit to the data. This linear fit had a slope of 12.2 and an R2 of 0.39. This ratio is greater than what is typically observed in US cities. Data from the Xi'an campaign were compared to a previous campaign in Mexico City, Mexico to contrast relative abundances of CO, NOx, and VOCs.},

  Abstract                 = {Efforts to improve energy efficiency in homes and buildings have led to tighter structures. However, these changes can also produce negative consequences for indoor air quality and human health. One of the dramatic effects of climate change and weather is the increase in destructive wildfires, such as those experienced in the Pacific Northwest during the summer of 2015. The current article presents data for measurements at two houses during periods with and without high levels of wildfire smoke outdoors. For each house, indoor and outdoor pollutant measurements were obtained for ozone (O3), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and volatile organic compounds along with outdoor weather conditions and occupant activities including the use of windows and doors. The volatile organic compound measurements were obtained using a Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometer. Compounds monitored included acetonitrile (a biomass burning tracer), formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, methanol, acetone, benzene, toluene, and C2-alkylbenzenes (i.e., sum of xylenes and ethylbenzene), C3-alkylbenzenes (i.e., sum of trimethylbenzene, ethyltoluene, and propylbenzene isomers), and C4-alkylbenzenes (i.e., sum of tetramethylbenzene and its isomers). A carbon dioxide tracer method was used to measure in situ ventilation rates, and blower door tests were also completed to determine standard ventilation rates. For smoky periods with elevated outdoor pollutant levels, penetration factors, defined as the ratio of indoor/outdoor concentrations were quite low. Penetration factors for PM2.5 were 11% for H2 and 15% for H3, except when windows or doors were open. The penetration factors for O3 were also low at 24% for H2 and 5% for H3. Elevated indoor volatile organic compound levels were not typically associated with outdoor levels, but reflected significant indoor sources. During smoke events, acetonitrile, a biomass burning tracer compound, was elevated outdoors and indoors in both houses, and benzene was elevated outdoors and indoors in H3.},

  Abstract                 = {It is becoming increasingly important to investigate the relationship between global climate and agriculture in the face of ongoing climate change and the need to feed a growing global population. The REgional Approaches to Climate CHange (REACCH) USDA project is focused on Inland Pacific Northwest cereal cropping systems with an overarching goal to develop strategies for regional agriculture to mitigate and adapt to climate change. An important component of REACCH is to establish a baseline of greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes for current and alternate management practices. While cropping systems have the potential to sequester carbon in the soils, they are a net source of nitrous oxide (N2O), a greenhouse gas with three hundred times the warming potential of CO2. We report here initial micrometeorological flux measurements of N2O over a high rainfall, annual cropping system under no-tillage management. The measurements were collected from three-meter eddy covariance towers. Each tower is equipped with a sonic anemometer and peripheral meteorological instruments. Closed-path cavity ring down spectroscopy instruments were used to measure N2O fluxes via two techniques: eddy covariance and the modified Bowen ratio gradient method. The flux data from the two techniques are compared to each other and also to enclosure chamber measurements to determine viability and the range of uncertainty in the measurements. They are also analyzed for patterns associated with management events and meteorological conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {In the coming decades, as we experience global population growth and global aging issues, there will be corresponding concerns about the quality of the air we experience inside and outside buildings. Because we can anticipate that there will be behavioral changes that accompany population growth and aging, we examine the relationship between home occupant behavior and indoor air quality. To do this, we collect both sensor-based behavior data and chemical indoor air quality measurements in smart home environments. We introduce a novel machine learning-based approach to quantify the correlation between smart home features and chemical measurements of air quality, and evaluate the approach using two smart homes. The findings may help us understand the types of behavior that measurably impact indoor air quality. This information could help us plan for the future by developing an automated building system that would be used as part of a smart city.},

  Abstract                 = {Throughout the world and especially in Asia, rapid urbanization is resulting in an increasing number of very large cities. In these areas, the rate of development can outpace the perceived need for environmental regulation, and frequently there are inadequate resources available to monitor pollution or enforce compliance with those environmental regulations that do exist. These limitations obviously impact air quality on a local scale, but cities also have significant environmental impacts on regional and even global scales. In order to understand and mitigate these impacts on the surrounding environment, it is first necessary to robustly characterize the pollutant emissions themselves. This can be a significant challenge. Major discrepancies arise when comparing emissions inventories based on bottom-up compilations of source types, number, and activity levels to estimates inferred from satellite observations and other large-scale techniques. Direct measurements of neighborhood-scale emission fluxes via micrometeorological approaches provide a means to resolve these differences. Such measurements can be used to quantify the integrated vertical exchange for a wide variety of greenhouse gases and other pollutants, typically with spatial footprints of tens of square kilometers and with temporal resolutions of ~30 minutes. Here we present the results of an urban flux study conducted in Xi'an, China in August 2011. For the study a 23 m tower was erected atop the ~100 m tall administration building at Xi'an Jiaotong University. From the tower, we employed an eddy covariance approach to measure concentrations and fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and carbon monoxide (CO). Here we present an analysis of the air-surface exchange of these gases. Results indicate that while our study site in Xi'an was a net source of these species, the greenhouse gas fluxes were significantly smaller than at other sites around the world and exhibited a different diurnal pattern. We attribute these results to two factors: 1) the relatively low traffic density at the Xi'an study site relative to other urban flux sites; and 2) the presence of a large urban park in the northerly sector of the study footprint, where the vegetative sink for CO2 was often greater than anthropogenic sources. Overall the analysis suggests that even in heavily urbanized regions land use and activity profiles can have significant impacts on air pollutant emissions.},

  Abstract                 = {Agricultural soils have the potential to be an important carbon (C) sink with proper management. The main goal of this study was to characterize C dynamics and net C exchange over two full crop years at two sites in the inland Pacific Northwest (iPNW). The iPNW is a highly productive dryland wheat growing region. The two measurement sites represent the low- and high-end of the regional precipitation gradient (250 and 550 mm year−1, respectively). The low rainfall site is in a winter wheat-fallow rotation, while the high rainfall site is under continuous cropping with a rotation that includes winter wheat and pulse crops. The net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) was monitored using the eddy covariance method. The winter wheat cropping years were strong CO2 sinks, with net uptake of 517 ± 26 and 524 ± 29 g C m−2 year−1 at the high- and low-rainfall sites, respectively. The fallow and pulse-crop years were close to neutral with respect to NEE, with a net uptake of 20 ± 38 g C m−2 year−1 for garbanzo beans at the high rainfall site, and a net loss of 3 ± 19 g C m−2 year−1 for the fallow season at the low rainfall site. Combining NEE with other carbon exchange terms, most importantly carbon import and export via seeding and harvest, gives the net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB). We found that even when harvest export was taken into account, both sites acted as net carbon sinks over the two year period: the NECB at the continuous cropping site was 202 ± 60 g C m−2, and the crop-fallow site had a NECB of 444 ± 34 g C m−2. These results present useful insights to field-scale C dynamics on finely resolved timescales. To understand the potential of soils as a long term C sink however, longer-term monitoring over multiple complete crop rotation cycles in combination with other field measurements or process-based models will be necessary.},

  Abstract                 = {Characterizing the dynamics of greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes in agricultural systems is becoming increasingly important in the face of population growth and climate change. Monitoring baseline fluxes of both carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) over agroecosystems allows for a better understanding of how climate and management practices affect the GHG budget of a given field. In this study, fluxes of CO2 and N2O were measured and compared using the eddy covariance (EC) technique and four automated static chambers (LI-8100A). The site is outfitted with an EC tower to continuously measure fluxes of CO2, H2O, and energy as well as auxiliary meteorological variables. Both the chamber system and N2O instrument were added for a month-long period following spring fertilization and seeding. The difference in scales between the tower and the chambers allowed for analysis of the spatial variability of fluxes. For N2O, the spatial variability was very high, with up to ten-fold differences in fluxes between the four chambers. However, the magnitude of the tower-based fluxes was closest to that of the highest-emitting chamber. In addition to addressing spatial variability, the chamber measurements helped to characterize nighttime fluxes, when stable conditions often lead to gaps in eddy covariance data. Box modeling techniques were also used to fill in nocturnal data gaps. The relationship between N2O fluxes and meteorological conditions was analyzed, as well as the relationship between N2O emissions and CO2 respiration. It was found that the total N2O-N emission from the site in the one-month period following fertilization exceeded the IPCC estimate of 1% of fertilizer-N applied.

  Abstract                 = {Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas and ozone depleting substance. Agricultural soils are the primary source of N2O, which is created as a by-product of soil microbial processes. The production and emission of N2O is characterized by high spatial and temporal variability, or "hot spots" and "hot moments". These behaviors, along with limitations in instrument sensitivity to N2O, are challenges in characterizing emissions. Many studies have monitored N2O emissions using either static chambers or micrometeorological measurements or the two methods together. The two techniques are complementary: chamber methods have a lower detection limit and are more reliable as their operation does not depend on atmospheric conditions, but may not capture spatial variability even with multiple chambers. Tower-based methods are subject to relatively high data loss due to non-ideal conditions and to less sensitive detection limits, but have a larger measurement footprint and can characterize field-scale emissions. This study aims to characterize a long-term, field-scale N2O budget over two winter wheat fields located in the Inland Pacific Northwest of the United States, both in terms of an annual emission budget and in terms of understanding what causes hot moments. We combined continuous measurements of N2O emissions from a system of sixteen automated, static chambers with tower-based measurements of N2O fluxes. We used the modified Bowen ratio (MBR) technique with temperature as a tracer. Preliminary results indicate that freeze-thaw cycles in the winter make up a higher percentage of annual emissions than previously thought. Furthermore, comparison of the chamber results to the tower-based measurements imply that the chambers may be underestimating field-scale N2O fluxes because they are not adequately capturing hot spots of emissions. We are conducting ongoing work on how to integrate the two measurement techniques, as well as how the empirical measurements compare with other measures of N2O emissions for the region.},

  Abstract                 = {Agricultural soils are the main anthropogenic source of nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas (GHG) and ozone depleting substance. Due to a high degree of both spatial and temporal variability coupled with limited availability of high-precision N2O sensors, emissions of N2O are difficult to quantify at the regional and field levels, scales important for determining best management practices. This study combined the use of automated static chambers and the flux gradient micrometeorological technique to continuously monitor emissions of N2O over two canola fields with differing tillage management: no-tillage and conventional tillage. Each site was instrumented with an array of sixteen chambers for the entire 2015 crop year (1 Oct - 30 Sept), and the N2O emissions were measured with the flux gradient method from 1 April thru 30 September. The chamber measurements indicated cumulative annual emissions of 6.0 and 3.1 kg N2O-N ha-1 for the conventional tillage and no-tillage sites, respectively, or 4.8% and 2.5% of applied fertilizer N. Emissions at the conventional tillage site were very low until the field was planted and fertilized, when emissions increased dramatically and stayed high until crop senesce. The growing season (1 April - June 15) accounted for 80% of total measured N2O losses (4.8 kg N2O-N ha-1). In contrast, the no-till site was characterized by consistent moderate emissions, and no spike after planting and fertilization was observed. The growing season only accounted for 30% of the total emissions (1.0 kg N2O-N ha-1). However, even sixteen chambers may not properly capture hot spots of emissions, and the spatially integrated flux gradient results did not corroborate the chamber results. The total emissions measured by the flux gradient method over the growing season were 1.6 and 1.4 kg N2O-N ha-1 for the conventional tillage and no-till sites, respectively. Further work on integrating the two techniques will be necessary to optimize characterization of the spatial and temporal variability of N2O emissions in this region.},
